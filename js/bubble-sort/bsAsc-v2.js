/**
 * Bubble-sorts an array of numbers in ascending order.
 *
 * Good implementation as on each iteration of the outer loop, we work
 * on an every-shrinking portion of the array to avoid working on
 * already-sorted elements.
 *
 * Also, after each pass a check is performed to know if there has been
 * a swap in the previous pass. If there has not been a swap, it is
 * clear the array is sorted at this point and no further iterations are
 * necessary.
 *
 * - T.C: O(n) for best case scenario (array is already almost entirely
 *        sorted, but O(nÂ²) if not.
 * - S.C: O(1).
 *
 * @sig [Number] -> [Number]
