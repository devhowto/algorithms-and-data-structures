= Missing Digit
:page-subtitle: Eval Math Expression

== Intro

Have seen this in a coding interview on Coderbyte.
Also check the similar link:https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-unknown-digit[Find The Unknown Digit :: Codewars 4kyu].

The input expression has this form:

[,text]
----
operandA operator operandB = result
----

Assume the spaces will always be there.
And we can simplify like this:

[,text]
----
a o b = r
----

Some examples:

[,text]
----
3 + 2 = x     //=> 5

5 - x = 3     //=> 2

x / 2 = 4     //=> 8

12x + 2 = 125 //=> 3
----

== Thinking about the solution

* When stem:[x] is on stem:[r], no matter the operation:
** Apply the operation to stem:[a] and stem:[b] to find stem:[r].
* Else, when the operation is addition or multiplication:
** Apply the inverse operation on stem:[r] and the known operand.
   For example, for stem:[x + 2 = 5], do stem:[5 - 2] to find stem:[a = 3], and for stem:[3 + x = 5], do stem:[5 - 3] to find stem:[b = 2].
* Else, when the operation is subtraction or division:
** When the known operand is on stem:[a]:
*** Apply the operation on stem:[a] and stem:[r].
    For example, for stem:[8 / x = 4], do stem:[8 / 4] to find stem:[b = 2].
** Else, when the known operand is on stem:[b]:
*** Apply the inverse operation on stem:[r] and stem:[b].
    For example, for stem:[x - 2 = 3], do stem:[3 + 2] to find stem:[a = 5].
