= Recursion

== Intro

Recursion is a different way of thinking about writing solutions.
It is a function/procedure/method/process that calls it self with new input until the base case is reached and a final result is produced.
It is a form of looping except without using things like `for`, `while`, etc.

Some algorithms are much simpler if implemented using recursion.
Some are impossible without recursion.
For example, to parse or stringify JSON, recursion is much more appropriate than other sorts of loops.
Traversing the DOM or any sort of object traversal, trees, graphs are generally easier using recursion too.

Algorithms making use of recursion must make sure to:

* handle the base case
* Pass different input in each invocation so that it will eventually reach the base case

Recursion also involves the call stack, and some languages offer techniques like _Tail Call Optimization_ (TCO) or _Tail Call Elimination_ (TCE) to improve performance and make recursion on larger data sets possible at all.

ECMAScript does not feature TCO or TCE, so recursion must be used responsibly in this language.

Recursion can also be done using *pure recursion* or *helper function recursion*.

== The Call Stack

Almost all programming languages feature the so called *call stack*, which is an internal data structure to that programming language that stores information about the calling of functions.

When a function is called, it is added to the stack, and when it returns, it is popped from the stack.

If the call stack keeps being added functions, at some point a limit will be reached a stack overflow error/exception will happen.

== countdown()

A function that logs integers from `n` down to 0.

*TIME COMPLEXITY*: stem:[O(n)] since all integers from `n` to 0 have to be worked upon.
The number of recursive invocations is directly proportional to `n`.

*SPACE COMPLEXITY*: stem:[O(1)] as no extra storage is used.
The call stack is not part of T.C big O concern.

/**
 * Logs number from `num` to 0.
 *
 * ASSUME: `num >= 0`.
 *
 * - T.C: `O(n)`.
 * - S.C: `O(1)`.
 *
 * @sig Number -> Void
 */
function countdown(num) {
  if (num <= 0) {
    console.log(n);
    console.info("All done!");
    return;
  }

  console.log(num);

  countdown(--num);
}

== sumRange(n)

*TIME COMPLEXITY*: stem:[O(n)].
It recurses as many times as is the value of `n`.

*SPACE COMPLEXITY*: stem:[O(1)].
Only one numeric variable is used.
The call stack is not considered as part of space complexity.

It works like this:

Let f be sumRange (for shortness).

f(5)
 5 + f(4)     → on the call stack
  4 + f(3)    → ...
   3 + f(2)   → ...
    2 + f(1)  → ...
     1        → no more recursive calls, start unwinding
    2 + 1     → pop f(2) from the call stack
   3 + 3      → pop f(3) + result of previous call
  4 + 6       → pop f(4) + result of previous call
5 + 10        → pop f(5) + result of previous call
