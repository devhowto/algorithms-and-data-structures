= Sliding Window Examples

== longestUniqSubSeq()

Problem: given a string the find the longest sequence of unique characters.

For instance, in "hellothere", "hel" is the first sequence of unique chars, because then "l" is repeated.
Then, we start at the next "l" and the next unique sequence of chars is "lother".

== maxSubArrSum()

Write a function which accepts an array of integers `xs` and an integer `len` and computes the maximum sum of `len` consecutive elements in `xs`.

=== v1 nested loops

*TIME COMPLEXITY*: stem:[O(n^2)] because there is a loop inside a loop.

*SPACE COMPLEXITY*: stem:[O(1)] as no extra storage is required besides a few control variables to store numbers.

<1> This is necessary as are always *looking ahead* so we avoid looking past the end of the input array.

=== v2 sliding window approach

This solution is stem:[O(n)] time complexity because only one loop is performed.

*TIME COMPLEXITY*: stem:[O(n)] as it runs a single loop.

*SPACE COMPLEXITY*: stem:[O(1)] as no extra space is required besides a few control variables that store numbers.

<1> `-Infinity` because we need to take the into account the fact that the sum could be negative.
Starting with 0 would be a bad decision here.

Consider this example:

image::max-sub-arr-sum-sliding-window.png[max sub array sum sliding window logic]

We keep looping the input array, sliding the window one element at at time, each time subtracting the left element of the previous window, and adding the new element that the window slides on to.
