= Divide and Conquer Examples

The divide and conquer approach is mostly used with searching algorithms.

For example, the goal is to find the index of a sorted array of integers, it could be looped from beginning to end, until the index was found or not found at all.
This approach has time complexity stem:[O(n)].
But if an approach like Binary Search is applied, then time complexity reduces to stem:[O(log_{2}(n))].

=== v1 naive approach

**TIME COMPLEXITY**: stem:[O(n)] as each element of the array is inspected in turn.

**SPACE COMPLEXITY**: stem:[O(1)] as no extra space is used.

=== v2 binary search

**TIME COMPLEXITY**: stem:[logâ‚‚(n)] as binary search is performed reducing the number of operations performed to find the index.

**SPACE COMPLEXITY**: stem:[O(1)] as no extra space is used.
