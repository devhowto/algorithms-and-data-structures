= Dedup Spaces and Dropcap

Based on the link:https://www.codewars.com/kata/559e5b717dd758a3eb00005a[Dropcaps 7kyu Codewars challenge^], except we also remove excess spaces between words.
For example, "  foo      bar  x " becomes "foo bar x"

== Haskell

=== Solution 1

[source,haskell]
----
import Data.Char (toLower, toUpper, isSpace)
import Data.List (dropWhileEnd)

trim :: String -> String
trim = dropWhileEnd isSpace . dropWhile isSpace

trimAll :: String -> String
trimAll = unwords . map trim . words

upcaseFirst :: [Char] -> [Char]
upcaseFirst "" = ""
upcaseFirst (c : cs) = toUpper c : map toLower cs

dropCap :: [Char] -> [Char]
dropCap str = unwords . map trim $ go [] (words str)
  where
    go :: [String] -> [String] -> [String]
    go acc [] = acc
    go acc (s : ss)
      | length s >= 3 = go (acc ++ [upcaseFirst s]) ss
      | otherwise     = go (acc ++ [s]) ss
----


However, note the implementation of `trimAll`:

[source,haskell]
----
trimAll :: String -> String
trimAll = unwords . map trim . words
----

It turns out `works` already removes whitespace, which means, just by using `words` will already return an array of “trimmed” strings:

[source,text]
----
λ> words "  May the force     be   with  you.     "
["May","the","force","be","with","you."]
----

So we can implement `trim` in this kinda surprising simple and unexpected way:

[source,haskell]
----
trimAll :: String -> String
trimAll = unwords . words
--
-- λ> trimAll "  May the force     be   with  you.      "
-- "May the force be with you."
--
