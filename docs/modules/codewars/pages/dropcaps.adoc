One more or less implicit sub-challenge is actually _keeping the spaces_.
We should not trim spaces from both sides of the string, neither _dedup_ spaces between words.

== Haskell

If we use `words` and `unwords` to extract the words and then join them back into a single string, we end up trimming each word, therefore _deduping_ the spaces.
We need some sort of more standard splitting.

=== Solution 1

[source,haskell]
----
import Data.Char (toLower, toUpper)
import Data.List (intercalate)

upcaseFirst :: [Char] -> [Char]
upcaseFirst ""     = ""
upcaseFirst (c:cs) = toUpper c : map toLower cs

split :: Char -> String -> [String]
split c s = case rest of
              []     -> [chunk]
              _:rest -> chunk : split c rest
  where (chunk, rest) = break (== c) s

dropCap :: String -> String
dropCap str = intercalate " " $ go [] (split ' ' str)
  where
    go :: [String] -> [String] -> [String]
    go acc [] = acc
    go acc (s : ss)
      | length s >= 3 = upcaseFirst s : go acc ss
      | otherwise     = s : go acc ss
----

The `upcaseFirst` and `split` functions were created as helpers.

The `go` inner function properly capitalizes the first char strings of stem:[\text{length} >= 3].

At the very end, we apply `intercalate " "` to the result of `go` to turn the list of strings back into a single string.

`split` keeps an empty string in place of each place it could split on space, which later when `intercalate` comes into play, ends up adding back all the spaces from the original string.

Here's how `split` is working:

[source,text]
----
Î»> split ' ' "  abc de   f  "
["","","abc","de","","","f","",""]
----

Note how each whitespace is turned into a `""` empty string in the resulting array.
That is what allows intercalate later to reconstruct the string with the original spaces in place.
