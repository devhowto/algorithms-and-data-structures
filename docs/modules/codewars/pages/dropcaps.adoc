= Dropcaps :: 7kyu Codewars Challenge

* link:https://www.codewars.com/kata/559e5b717dd758a3eb00005a[Dropcaps 7kyu Codewars challenge^]

This challenge involves making sure every first character of a word whose length is greater than two is made uppercase, while all the remaining words should remain (or be made into) lowercase.

It also requires trimming whitespace from the beginning and end of the string, and making sure other whitespace is no longer than one, so that a string like "  foo    bar " is spaced as "foo bar".

== Haskell

=== Solution 1

[source,haskell]
----
import Data.Char (toLower, toUpper, isSpace)
import Data.List (dropWhileEnd)

trim :: String -> String
trim = dropWhileEnd isSpace . dropWhile isSpace

trimAll :: String -> String
trimAll = unwords . map trim . words

upcaseFirst :: [Char] -> [Char]
upcaseFirst "" = ""
upcaseFirst (c : cs) = toUpper c : map toLower cs

dropCap :: [Char] -> [Char]
dropCap str = unwords . map trim $ go [] (words str)
  where
    go :: [String] -> [String] -> [String]
    go acc [] = acc
    go acc (s : ss)
      | length s >= 3 = go (acc ++ [upcaseFirst s]) ss
      | otherwise     = go (acc ++ [s]) ss
----


However, note the implementation of `trimAll`:

[source,haskell]
----
trimAll :: String -> String
trimAll = unwords . map trim . words
----

It turns out `works` already removes whitespace, which means, just by using `words` will already return an array of “trimmed” strings:

[source,text]
----
λ> words "  May the force     be   with  you.     "
["May","the","force","be","with","you."]
----

So we can implement `trim` in this kinda surprising simple and unexpected way:

[source,haskell]
----
trimAll :: String -> String
trimAll = unwords . words
--
-- λ> trimAll "  May the force     be   with  you.      "
-- "May the force be with you."
--
