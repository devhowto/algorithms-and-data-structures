 * Sorts an array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.

 * This is a very good implementation such on each iteration, an ever
 * shrinking portion of the input array is worked upon and no
 * unnecessary comparisons are performed.
 *
 * Also, after each pass a check is performed to know if there has been
 * a swap in the previous pass. If there has not been a swap, it is
 * clear the array is sorted at this point and no further iterations are
 * necessary.
 *
 * - T.C: O(n) for best case scenario (array is already almost entirely
 *        sorted, but O(nÂ²) if not.
 * - S.C: O(n).
